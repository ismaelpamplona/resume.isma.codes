about:
  title: About me
  data:
    - I'm a curious engineer with over a decade of experience in the technology industry, constantly learning and adapting. From Operations to Backend and Front-end roles, I've led teams up to 30 people and embraced diverse responsibilities, from management to programing. My experience as a company founder instilled an aptitude for marrying promising tech with business value.
    - For the past 5 years I've specialized in customer-centric web apps on cloud servers. The agility of crafting various applications, combined with my thirst for in-depth knowledge, empowers me to continually captivate users. I've written plenty of Python, Typescript, and other technologies throughout my career, but when I discovered Rust a couple of years ago, I immediately fell in love with it.
