About me:
  I'm an inquisitive engineer, constantly learning and adapting. From Operations to Backend and Frontend roles, I've led teams and embraced diverse responsibilities. My experience as a founder instilled a knack for marrying promising tech with business value.

  For the past 5 years, I've specialized in customer-centric web apps on cloud servers. The agility of crafting various applications, combined with my thirst for depth, empowers me to continually captivate users. I've written plenty of Python, Typescript, and various other technologies throughout my career, but when I discovered Rust a couple of years ago, I immediately fell in love with it.
